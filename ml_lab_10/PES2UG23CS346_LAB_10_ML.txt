Report: Week 10 – SVM Classifier Lab

Objective:
The experiment focuses on understanding and implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using different kernel functions. It demonstrates how SVMs can separate classes in both linear and non-linear datasets.

Overview:
The notebook introduces SVM theory, including the concept of the kernel trick, and compares the behavior of three kernel types:

Linear Kernel: Produces straight-line decision boundaries.

RBF Kernel: Handles complex, non-linear data separations.

Polynomial Kernel: Forms curved, polynomial-based boundaries.

Methodology:

Data is generated and preprocessed using datasets such as the Moons dataset, which is ideal for non-linear classification tasks.

The SVM models are trained with each kernel type.

A custom visualization function is used to plot the decision boundaries and observe how each model separates the data.

Performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.

Conclusion:
The notebook clearly illustrates how different SVM kernels affect decision boundaries and model performance. It reinforces understanding of linear vs. non-linear separability and the practical use of the kernel trick in SVMs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Mushroom: Achieves perfect performance across all metrics (100%). The dataset's noise-free nature and highly discriminative features (e.g., odor) enable complete class separation.
Nursery: Shows high accuracy (98.67%) and weighted metrics (0.987), but lower macro-averaged metrics (0.76) suggest challenges with minority classes due to imbalance.
Tic-Tac-Toe: Has the lowest accuracy (87.30%) and macro metrics (~0.86), reflecting complex interdependencies among board positions and a smaller dataset.
Calculation Explanation: 
Accuracy is computed as correct predictions divided by total predictions (e.g., Mushroom: 1625/1625 = 1.0; Nursery: ~2557/2592 ≈ 0.9867; Tic-Tac-Toe: ~168/192 ≈ 0.8730).
Macro-precision, recall, and F1-score are averages of per-class metrics, with Nursery’s lower values reflecting rare class issues and Tic-Tac-Toe’s moderate values indicating balanced but challenging classification.



2. Tree Characteristics Analysis
Tree characteristics for the datasets are compared based on the provided complexity metrics.

Maximum Depth:
Mushroom: 4, reflecting a shallow tree due to high-gain attributes achieving early class purity.
Nursery: 7, indicating deeper splits for multi-class complexity.
Tic-Tac-Toe: 7, driven by the need to capture board pattern combinations.


Total Nodes:
Mushroom: 29 (compact).
Nursery: 952 (large due to multi-class decisions).
Tic-Tac-Toe: 281 (moderate, reflecting board complexity).


Most Important Features:
Mushroom: Root is 'odor' (info gain 0.9083), followed by 'spore-print-color' (0.1469), 'habitat' (0.2217), 'gill-size' (0.7642), and 'cap-color' (0.7300).
Nursery: Likely 'health' or 'has_nurs' due to high correlation with child care decisions.
Tic-Tac-Toe: Likely 'middle-middle-square' (based on standard dataset analysis), as the center position is critical for wins.


Tree Complexity:
Mushroom (8124 instances, 22 features): Small tree due to large dataset and balanced classes.
Nursery (12960 instances, 8 features): Large tree due to imbalance and multi-class decisions.
Tic-Tac-Toe (958 instances, 9 features): Moderately complex tree due to interdependent features.



3. Dataset-Specific Insights
Mushroom Dataset

Feature Importance: 'Odor' (info gain 0.9083) is most critical, followed by 'spore-print-color' (0.1469), 'habitat' (0.2217), 'gill-size' (0.7642), and 'cap-color' (0.7300), as these biological traits strongly predict edibility.
Class Distribution: Balanced (edible: 51.8%, poisonous: 48.2%).
Decision Patterns: Short paths like odor = 0, 3, 5 (subset), 8 → poisonous (class 1) and odor = 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 → edible (class 0), with further splits for nuanced cases.
Overfitting Indicators: None; perfect train and test accuracy (100%) and shallow depth (4) align with the noise-free dataset.

Nursery Dataset

Feature Importance: Likely centers on 'health' and 'has_nurs', which typically dominate due to their correlation with child care decisions.
Class Distribution: Imbalanced: not_recom (33%), priority (33%), spec_prior (33%), very_recom (0.5%), recommend (~0.02%).
Decision Patterns: Short paths like health = not_recom → not_recom; complex paths for minority classes, with deeper paths up to depth 7.
Overfitting Indicators: Minimal; train accuracy (~99%) versus test (98.67%), but large tree (952 nodes) suggests potential over-specialization for minority classes.

Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset

Feature Importance: Likely prioritizes 'middle-middle-square', followed by 'top-middle-square' and 'bottom-middle-square', as central and row positions are critical for wins.
Class Distribution: Imbalanced: positive (win for x, 65.3%), negative (34.7%).
Decision Patterns: Paths like middle-middle = x + adjacent matches → positive and empty or o in key positions → negative, mimicking game rules.
Overfitting Indicators: Moderate; train accuracy (~92%) versus test (87.30%), with depth (7) and size (281 nodes) indicating potential over-specialization to board configurations.

4. Comparative Analysis Report
a) Algorithm Performance

Highest Accuracy: Mushroom achieves the highest accuracy (100%) due to its noise-free nature and discriminative features (e.g., odor with info gain 0.9083), allowing a perfect, compact tree.
Dataset Size Impact: Mushroom’s 8124 instances ensure robust splits, Nursery’s 12960 instances are offset by imbalance, and Tic-Tac-Toe’s 958 instances lead to overfitting.
Feature Count Role: Mushroom’s 22 features allow fine-grained splits but select high-gain ones, Nursery’s 8 features lead to a large tree due to multi-class complexity, and Tic-Tac-Toe’s 9 features create a moderately complex tree due to interdependent board positions.

b) Data Characteristics Impact

Class Imbalance: Mushroom’s balanced classes result in even splits and a compact tree. Nursery’s imbalance biases the tree toward majority classes, lowering macro metrics (0.76). Tic-Tac-Toe’s imbalance (65.3% positive) biases toward the majority class, with moderate macro metrics (0.86).
Feature Types: Multi-valued features work better: Mushroom’s 'odor' (9 values) and Nursery’s 'has_nurs' (5 values) enable efficient multi-way splits, while Tic
